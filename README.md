### UPDATE: This service/utility also works with [localtunnel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel)

Ngrok-dns is a plugin of sorts to the [ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngrok/ngrok) npm package that enables domain features of ngrok which are not available on the free plan.
Ngrok-dns will create a TXT record pointing to the new tunnel each time it changes.

Further you can generate a fixed URL using the service at https://ngrok-dns.june07.com.

| highlighed locations show requirement for ngrok-dns usage | similar setup for localtunnel usage |

### ngrok usage
```javascript
const ngrok = require('@ngrok/ngrok'),
    dnsTunnel = require('@667/ngrok-dns');

(async function () {
    const listener = await ngrok.forward({
        addr: 'https://localhost:3000',
        on_status_change: dnsTunnel,
        authtoken: NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN,
        verify_upstream_tls: false
    })
})();
```
### localtunnel usage
```javascript
const localtunnel = require('localtunnel'),
    dnsTunnel = require('@667/ngrok-dns');

(async () => {
    const tunnel = await localtunnel({
        port: 3000,
        allow_invalid_cert: true,
        local_https: true,
        debug: true,
    });
    dnsTunnel(tunnel.url);
    console.log(`dnsTunnel: ${tunnel.url}`);
})();
```

Make sure your env vars are set and run your app or app dev command (i.e. nodemon, etc) as normal:
[![ngrok-dns](https://res.cloudinary.com/june07/image/upload/v1606675846/june07/Capture-commandLine-ngrok-dns.png)](https://github.com/june07/ngrok-dns)
* TXT - A DNS TXT record is created which can easily be looked up in your dev environment using Node's included dns module:
    `require('dns')`
* CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN
* CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID

Log output should look like:
`ngrok-dns added Cloudflare TXT your-custom-domain.com -> 0d8b12e869d7.ngrok.io`

This is a seperate example of ngrok-dns output:

Currently Cloudflare (token based) is supported although other DNS providers should be easy to add.

* ngrokDNS is middleware in that it passes the onLogEvent 'data' through, and failures just disable the middleware
